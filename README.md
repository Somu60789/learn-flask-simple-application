I am just starting into web development with python

- use "<b>python3 -m venv venv</b>" to create virtual env
- use "<b>source venv/bin/activate</b>" to enter into virtual env
- use "<b>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</b>" to install required packages
- use "<b>pip3 freeze requirements.txt</b>" to get all the packages currently using into the file
- <b>ORM : sqlalchamy</b>
- For installing packages
  - go to virtual environment terminal
  - install flask with pip "<b>pip3 install flask</b>"
