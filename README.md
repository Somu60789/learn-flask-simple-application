# learn-flask-simple-application

I am just starting into web development with python

- use "python3 -m venv venv" to create virtual env
- use "source venv/bin/activate" to enter into virtual env
- use "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" to install required packages
- use "pip3 freeze requirements.txt" to get all the packages currently using into the file
- For installing packages
  - go to virtual environment terminal
  - install flask with pip "pip3 install flask"
